Description
Dungeons and Donuts is an original first-person 3D video game that&rsquo;s divided into combat-focused and platforming-focused gameplay based on its size-changing mechanic. It was developed using Unreal Engine 5.
Enter the sewers as a buff wizard, pummeling foes in combat and moving heavy obstacles via telekinesis. Find the magical donuts contained in the sewers&rsquo; depths. Escape the sewers as a smaller (weaker?), magic-free version of yourself.
Dungeons and Donuts was released to itch.io on 2/5/2025.
