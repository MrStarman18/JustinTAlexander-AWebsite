Description
&ldquo;Legends tell of a mystical die named Snogbert&hellip;
Does he have infinite sides, or only one?&rdquo;
Snogbert is a 2D platformer with characteristics of the roguelike/roguelite and arcade genres. It stars Snogbert–a mythical infinite-sided die–and his quest to return home after falling into a cave network inhabited by other sentient dice.
The game features a “die roll” system that randomly assigns the criteria to complete each level. So, while the same set of levels is traversed with each run, players are encouraged to think about them differently every time.">
