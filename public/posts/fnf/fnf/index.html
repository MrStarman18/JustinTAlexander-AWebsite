Business Angles: FNF Dave Mod
Description
Looking for a rap battle, Boyfriend and Girlfriend have found themselves outside of Pythagoras Corp., an office building staffed entirely by triangles! It doesn&rsquo;t take long for one hopeful salesman to step up to the challenge, sizing them up as an easy contract. Will Boyfriend be able to outperform this pint-sized pen-pusher? Or will he give in to the tricks of the trade?">
