Description
Our team of 5 received a challenge: using nothing but SFML with C&#43;&#43;, program a fully-functional video game in one semester.
Our answer was Dog Dash, a 2-D infinite dog-walker (inf. runner). Jump over an endless stream of fire hydrants and compete for the high score in this simple-yet-difficult game!
