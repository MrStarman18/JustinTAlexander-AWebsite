Description
DSSM is a basket-catcher game prototype created in collaboration with the creators of the Dead Sea Squirrels television show/book series. It was designed with the pitch of creating a mobile game based on the series.
DSSM follows Merle and Pearl, the show&rsquo;s main characters, as they harvest acorns and chicken nuggets from the treetops and learn some Scripture along the way.
The game was developed using Unreal Engine 5. Development was paused after completing a proof of concept.">
