Description
Guns of Salvation is a 2.5D Metroidvania set in the realm of Lleh. It follows Iris and her journey to defeat the Seven Deadly Sins and free the cherubs trapped around the realm. It was developed using Unreal Engine 5.4.
I was brought on to this project to design and implement the three boss fights that are featured in its spring demo: Sloth, Gluttony, and Wrath. This involved frequent meetings with the team&rsquo;s leads, weekly progress reports, and coherent design documentation.">
