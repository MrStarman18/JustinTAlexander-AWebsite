# Description
The Lunatic Labs Data Warehouse is a data storage application developed for internal use by Lipscomb University, especially on mission trips.

My work was primarily focused on the Warehouse's user-facing interface, a library of Python functions, using JSON and Pycurl libraries to communicate with the server.
