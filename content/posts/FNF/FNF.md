# Business Angles: FNF Dave Mod

## Description
Looking for a rap battle, Boyfriend and Girlfriend have found themselves outside of Pythagoras Corp., an office building staffed entirely by triangles! It doesn't take long for one hopeful salesman to step up to the challenge, sizing them up as an easy contract. Will Boyfriend be able to outperform this pint-sized pen-pusher? Or will he give in to the tricks of the trade? 

Find out in Business Angles, where you face off against Dave, the three-sided businessman who just can't seem to take no for an answer!
