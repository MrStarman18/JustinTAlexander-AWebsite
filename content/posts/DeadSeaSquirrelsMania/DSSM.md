# Description
*DSSM* is a basket-catcher game prototype created in collaboration with the creators of the *Dead Sea Squirrels* television show/book series. It was designed with the pitch of creating a mobile game based on the series.

*DSSM* follows Merle and Pearl, the show's main characters, as they harvest acorns and chicken nuggets from the treetops and learn some Scripture along the way.
