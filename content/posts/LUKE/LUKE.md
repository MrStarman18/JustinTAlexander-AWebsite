# Description
The Lipscomb University Kiosk Experience (L.U.K.E.) is a multi-screen kiosk designed to inform and engage. From answering visitor questions to providing fun, interactive experiences, this cutting-edge system showcases the power of technology in enhancing campus navigation and exploration.

L.U.K.E. is built on Processing 4 Java. Work was done to integrate technologies such as Large-Language Model AI. The kiosk was deployed in Lipscomb's Fields Engineering Center in November 2024.
