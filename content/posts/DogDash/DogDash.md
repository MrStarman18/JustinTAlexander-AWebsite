# Description
Our team of 5 received a challenge: using nothing but SFML with C++, program a fully-functional video game in one semester.

Our answer was *Dog Dash*, a 2-D infinite dog-walker (inf. runner). Jump over an endless stream of fire hydrants and compete for the high score in this simple-yet-difficult game!
