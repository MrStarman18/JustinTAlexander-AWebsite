# Description
*Dungeons and Donuts* is an original first-person 3D video game that's divided into combat-focused and platforming-focused gameplay based on its size-changing mechanic. It was developed using Unreal Engine 5.

Enter the sewers as a buff wizard, pummeling foes in combat and moving heavy obstacles via telekinesis. Find the magical donuts contained in the sewers' depths. Escape the sewers as a smaller (weaker?), magic-free version of yourself.

*Dungeons and Donuts* was released to itch.io on 2/5/2025.
