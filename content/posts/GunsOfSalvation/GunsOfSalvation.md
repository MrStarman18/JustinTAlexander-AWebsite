# Description
*Guns of Salvation* is a 2.5D Metroidvania set in the realm of Lleh. It follows Iris and her journey to defeat the Seven Deadly Sins and free the cherubs trapped around the realm. It was developed using Unreal Engine 5.4.

I was brought on to this project to design and implement the three boss fights that are featured in its spring demo: Sloth, Gluttony, and Wrath. This involved frequent meetings with the team's leads, weekly progress reports, and coherent design documentation.  

# Credits
Developed by a team of ~15 peers as a student capstone project.

On this project, I am credited as:
- Programmer (Unreal Blueprints)
- Game Designer (Boss fights)
