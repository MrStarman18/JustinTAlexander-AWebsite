# Description
*AD BLOCKER* is a fast-paced match-3 puzzler that’s built for head-to-head gameplay between 0-2 players. It was developed using Godot Engine 4.

*AD BLOCKER* features grid-based gravity and a unique linear garbage system. With a low skill floor and high skill ceiling, everyone will be able to play at their own pace. So whether you’re new to the action puzzle scene or a long-time genre fan of games like *Panel de Pon* and *TETRIS*, *AD BLOCKER* has something for you!

AD BLOCKER: An Action Puzzle Game was released on Steam on 2/28/2025.
